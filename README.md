《或许会进行下去呢？》
 The idea came from the laser projection keyboard my bf showed me. I didn't know it is already commericialized and pretty cheap actually, though the responsivity is slow.
Initially I thought the laser projected is detected by the sensor. Turned out the visible laser is only for the keyboard display. 
An infared field is actuallly projected and detected to determine the coordinate where the finger interruptes.

Several years, my roommate at college was learning to play the drum. She has a drum pad at dorm for practice. It is small and quite, simply to train the techniques of the player, and has similar feedback as real drums.
Though this pad is perfect for praticing, I think it would be a good idea to hear the sound, through a digital module. There comes the idea of projected drum.
If the IR field is projected onto the drum pad, we can probably create the sound by the position the drumsticks hit. Software processing enables dynamic sound effect to a headphone or a speaker.
It will be a very cheap, portable, volume-tunable instrument for both professionals and amateurs. A less professional version can be applied with a interactive video game.

The 'box' that integrated projector and detector is already made. The key is that drum pad exists for musicians, just lacking sound. V doesn't understand this and thought it could be used for all percussion instruments.
But his idea about applying a visible light field that makes the strikes visible is cool. Though it's similar to those light shows in parks, where people step on the ground and create a ripple.
